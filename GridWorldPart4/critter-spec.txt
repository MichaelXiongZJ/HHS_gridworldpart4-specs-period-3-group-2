* HunterCritter[a][b][c]
* Move towards a randomly chosen bug in its detection range(within 2 cells of its location(5by5) each step
* Eats a Bug by removing the Bug from its cell and move onto the bug’s location.
* Randomly choose an adjacent bug to eat.
* Eat only adjacent bugs, but if no adjacent bugs, randomly move to a Bug within 2 cells away. 
* If it doesn’t detect any bug, it moves around randomly like a regular Critter

2. 2 bugs that are each 2 cells away
3. no bugs within 2 cells
4. 1 bug that is 1 cell north, 1 bug that is 2 cells West. Bug should eat the bug 1 cell north first.
